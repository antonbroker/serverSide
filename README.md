Daily Calorie Management (RESTful API)

In this project, I developed a server-side application for managing daily calorie consumption using the following technologies and tools:

Node.js and Express.js: For building a RESTful web service and routing requests.
MongoDB: As a database to store user information and calorie consumption data.
Postman: For testing API requests (GET, POST) and verifying server functionality.
JSON: For data exchange between the server and client.
Git and GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
Key features of the application:

Adding calorie intake records via API requests.
Generating reports on consumed calories categorized by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, other).
Managing users and retrieving their data through REST API.
